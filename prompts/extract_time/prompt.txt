Manually WITHOUT GENERATION A CODE extract the times of availability of his_tag in **12-hour clock format** from the conversation and generate a JSON object containing arrays of the availability ranges in, separated by hyphensm as values, and week days as keys. Make sure no space between numbers and time formats like "am/pm" and "pm":
```json
{
  "Monday": ["X:YYam-X:YYam", "X:YYam-X:YYam"],
  "Tuesday": ["X:YYam-X:YYam", "X:YYam-X:YYam"],
  "Wednesday": ["X:YYam-X:YYam", "X:YYam-X:YYam"],
  "Thursday": ["X:YYam-X:YYam", "X:YYam-X:YYam"],
  "Friday": ["X:YYam-X:YYam", "X:YYam-X:YYam"]
}
```
If there is no available time, then generate empty lists for those days. Extract only those time ranges that are mentioned in the conversation.
