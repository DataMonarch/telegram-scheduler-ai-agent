Manually WITHOUT GENERATION A CODE extract the times of availability of his_tag in **12-hour clock format** from the conversation and generate a JSON object containing arrays of the availability ranges in, separated by hyphensm as values, and week days as keys. Make sure no space between numbers and time formats like "am/pm" and "pm":

Monday: [X:YYam/pm-X:YYam/pm, ...]
Tuesday: [X:YYam/pm-X:YYam/pm, ...]
Wednesday: [X:YYam/pm-X:YYam/pm, ...]
Thursday: [X:YYam/pm-X:YYam/pm, ...]
Friday: [X:YYam/pm-X:YYam/pm, ...]

If there is no available time, then generate empty lists for those days. Extract only those time ranges that are mentioned in the conversation.
